====================Kubernetes=And=Zalenium============
We have used 4 VMs to create cluster where 1 VM will be controller machine, 2 will be master and 3 will be nodes.

We have used kubespray which consists of ansible playbooks to create kubernetes cluster. 
You have mention the machine details in the host file of kubespray present inside inventory folder.
We have modified that kubespray ansible playbooks according to the Infosys network which is present in the Infygit repo https://infygit.ad.infosys.com/solutions/KubesprayKubernetes

Make sure that all the dependencies are installed and the controller is able to ping all the cluster machines.

To create a cluster, you have to run the cluster.yml file.
To delete a cluster, you have to run reset.yml file. 

We have currently 2 clusters setup in Infosys network. One is used for training purpose and another for team work.

Selenium grid yaml files are present in the https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/selenium

For zalenium deployment in cluster, you can refer the Infygit repo https://infygit.ad.infosys.com/solutions/ZaleniumKubernetes
