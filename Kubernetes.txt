====================Kubernetes=And=Zalenium============
We have used 4 VMs to create cluster where 1 VM will be controller machine, 2 will be master and 3 will be nodes.

We have used kubespray which consists of ansible playbooks to create kubernetes cluster. 
You have mention the machine details in the host file of kubespray present inside inventory folder.
We have modified that kubespray ansible playbooks according to the Infosys network which is present in the Infygit repo https://infygit.ad.infosys.com/solutions/KubesprayKubernetes

Make sure that all the dependencies are installed and the controller is able to ping all the cluster machines.

To create a cluster, you have to run the cluster.yml file.
To delete a cluster, you have to run reset.yml file. 

We have currently 2 clusters setup in Infosys network. One is used for training purpose and another for team work.

Selenium grid yaml files are present in the https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/selenium

For zalenium deployment in cluster, you can refer the Infygit repo https://infygit.ad.infosys.com/solutions/ZaleniumKubernetes

--> Diff b/w Kubernete and Swarm
    -> GUI for kubernete is available but for swarm is not available
    -> Kubernete can do autoscaling but not by swarm
    -> Load balancing is tough in kubernter while in swarm automatically
    -> Rollback does auto rollback bt not in swarm
    -> Im buit tool for logging in Kubernetes but not in Swarm
--> Kubernete is cluster management tool which is responsible for cluster deployent, scaling, descaling. 
--> Docker is used to create the container while Kubernete is used for communication b/w the container.
--> Container Orchastration : If microservice put in the diff diff contaier then this container orchastration is responsible for the 
    communication between this containers.
--> Google container Engine : It is container orchastation and management tool which is totally based on Kubernetes.
--> Feature of Kubernete :      
    Auto Scheduling
    Automated rollout roll back
--> Diff b/w kubernete and swarm
    -> Swarm is the default cluster management provided by Docker and can handle only simple container only while Kbernetes can handle complex
    container as well.
--> Node in the Kubernete is the main worker machine.
--> Kubernetes Namespaces: The main task of namespace is to divide the clster resorce between multiple users.
--> Pod : Pod is the one which multiple containers are running.
--> Node in the Kuber is VM, physical machine. Nodes provide the services to run the Pod on it. And this nodes are manages by Master. 
--> Heapster : It is a performance moniterning and matric colletion supported by kubernetes and it is open source.
--> Kubelet : It is lowest level of component in Kubernetes and responsible for running each and every slave machines, also responsible
    for communication b/w master and slave node. Kubelete runs on the basis of pods specification. 
--> Minikube : It is used to run the Kubernetes locally. And it runs a single node kubernete cluster.
--> Kubectl : It is command line tool and use for sending command to cluster.
--> Componenets of Kubernetes : 
    -> Master Node : kube-controller-manager, kube-apiserver, kubescheduller
    -> Slave Node : kubelet , kuberproxy
--> Master Node : It is responsible to control nodes.
--> Kube-controller-manager : It will use to compile diff controller services, for namespace creation, for garbage collectio.
    Tupes of Controller : Node, Endpoint, Replication
--> Kubeproxy : Runs on each node. It define the Network rules on the nodes and this rules allow you to communicate to your pods.
    Use for tcp/udp packgening and forwording on backend networks.
--> Kube-api server : It is use to validate the configuration data stored in etcd and the details of deployed cluster such as cluster state.
    and responsible for establishing connection b/w Kubernetes node and master node.
--> Kubescheduler : The kube-scheduler has the job of assigning the nodes to the newly created pods. Means responsible for distribution 
    of the workload on worker node.
--> ETCD : It store the configuration details and wright values. It is a type of database to store configuration info. 
--> Volume : It is a dorectory accessible to all container running in the pod.
--> Persistent Volumes : It is a peice of storage in Kubernete cluster. It's like a volume plugins like volume.

--> We can set a static IP for Kubernetes load balancer by changing the DNS records whenever Kubernetes Master assigns a new IP address.
--> Types of service in Kubernetes :
       Cluster Ip: Expose the service on cluster port inside the cluste. 
       Node Port : Expose the port to node 
       Loadbalance : Expose the service externally 
       External Name :
--> Load Balancing : It allows us to expose the services. Two types
    Internal load balance : balance load autommatically and allocate pods based on required conf.
    External load balance : Direct the traffic from external load to backend pod. 
--> Ingress Network: It is a set of rules that act as an entry point to Kubernete cluster. And it provide the access to service 
       through HTTP request so it is more secure. It is all about routing.  
--> Resource monitering : Kubernetes create the abstration at diff level like container, pods, service, and whole cluuster for resorce 
    monitering.
    Methods for Resource mmonitering : Proethuse, Grafana, CAdviser
--> Repica set and Replication Controller both are used for nummber of pod replica are running but the difference between them is the usage
    of selectors
    Replication Controller use equity based selectors : It allow the filteing by labelkey and value
    Replica Set use Set based selectors : Where you can define proper set.
--> Headless Service : It is a normal Service withot the clster ip and ypu can directly reach to the pods withot the need to access throgh a proxy
--> Fedrated Cluster : Multiple kubernete cluster can be created and managed toagather is known as fedrated cluster and it can be achinved
    using two things 1) cross cluster delivery 2) Sync resouce across cluster.
--> Worker/Slave node : It contains the required services to manage the netwokring between containers and commnicate with mmaster which
    allows you to assign a resurce to scheduled cntainers.
--> Replication Controller : It is an object which defines the pod template. It also control the parameter to scale the identical replica
    of Pod.
--> Replication Set : It is an interation on replication controller design with flexibility that find how the controller recongnize the
    pod it is meant to manage.
--> Deployment: It is common workload which can be directly created and managed. It uses Replication Set as building block which add 
    feature of life cycle management.
--> Daemon Set: It is an another set of Pod controller which run the copy of the Pod on every node. 
--> To attach things to running cont.
    kubectl attach <pod> -f <cont.>
--> To see cluster info
    kubectl cluster info
--> To create the resource 
    kubectl create -f <filename>
    To dlt resource
    kubectl delete -f <filename>
    To describe any perticular resource
    kubectl describe -f <filename>
--> To expose any Kubernetes object like Pod,replication controller etc
    kubectl expose
--> To get the logs of the container running in pod
    kubectl logs
--> To scale
